## 🛠️ ChucnyServer Patcher – Linux Installation Guide
This guide will help you set up your Linux environment and patch the **Pokémon GO 0.29-0.35 APK** to remove certificate pinning and allow it to connect to **ChucnyServer**. The patcher supports versions 0.29.0 all the way up to 0.35.0 without breaking the app or server.

### 📋 Prerequisites
To run the patcher interface and successfully re-pack the APK file, your system must have the following tools installed:
* **Java Development Kit (JDK)** – Required for signing and aligning the modified APK (`keytool` and `apksigner`).
* **Node.js (v14 or newer)** – Required to run the patching core engine.
* **apk-mitm** – The command-line utility that handles the certificate injection process.

### 🐧 Linux Installation Steps
Open your terminal and execute the commands corresponding to your Linux distribution:

#### For Ubuntu / Debian / Mint
```bash
# Update package repositories
sudo apt update

# Install Java (OpenJDK 17 is recommended)
sudo apt install -y openjdk-17-jdk

# Install Node.js and NPM
sudo apt install -y nodejs npm
```

#### For Arch Linux
```bash
sudo pacman -Syu
sudo pacman -S jdk17-openjdk nodejs npm
```

#### For Fedora
```bash
sudo dnf update
sudo dnf install java-17-openjdk-devel nodejs
```

#### Install apk-mitm (Globally via NPM)
Once Node.js and its package manager are installed, install `apk-mitm` globally on your machine:
```bash
sudo npm install -g apk-mitm
```

### ⚙️ How to Use the Patcher

<img src="screenshots/04_SCROT.png" style="width: 350px;"></img>

With all dependencies installed, you can proceed to modify your game client using either the graphical interface or the command line.

#### Option A: Using the ChucnyServer Patcher (UI)
1. Run the `/patcher/patcher.py` file
2. Click on the **"Select APK File"** button (or simply drag and drop your downloaded Pokémon GO 0.29.0 APK into the designated area).
3. Click the **"Start Patching Process"** button.
4. The interface will interact with your system utilities (`java`, `node`, `apk-mitm`) to decompile, inject network security overrides, and re-sign the package.
5. Save the output file, usually generated as `app-name-patched.apk`.

#### Option B: Using the Terminal Directly
If you prefer bypassing the web UI and running the process manually:
```bash
apk-mitm path/to/pokemon-go-0.29.0.apk
```
*This command will output a newly modified file with the `-patched.apk` suffix in the same directory.*

### 📱 Final Device Configuration
1. Transfer your newly generated patch file (`-patched.apk`) onto your Android device and install it.
2. Install the `CA.crt` file (found inside your server directory at `/chucnyserver/certs`) onto your phone storage as a trusted **CA Certificate** via system security settings.
3. Head over to your phone's Wi-Fi configuration and change your primary **DNS** server to match the IP address outputted by your active ChucnyServer terminal.
4. Launch Pokémon GO, select the **"Pokemon Trainer Club"** login option, enter any username/password combination, and enjoy your server!

## 💾 MariaDB
Note: MariaDB isn't needed, the server will save everything in <code>json</code> files. This feature still allows you to back up players, pokestops and gyms.
**How to use**:
1. Install MariaDB
2. Put the MariaDB port, password, name and username in <code>config.py</code>
3. Run the MariaDB database
4. Run <code>database.py</code> and type <code>/help</code> for help with commands

  
## 🗄️ How to Get Assets
1. Send a friend request to me at **@chucny** on Discord if you do not have the assets.
2. I will respond within a couple of hours to days and provide you with a download link to the assets.
3. **Download** the assets.
4. Paste the 152 asset files directly into the `/chucnyserver/assets` folder.
5. Run the server.

## ⚖️ Asset Distribution Disclaimer
The reason I cannot provide assets publicly is because it violates **Copyright Laws**. Pokémon and its trademarks are the **Intellectual Property (IP)** of **Nintendo and The Pokémon Company**. If this project distributed assets publicly, it would receive a **DMCA takedown**. By leaving assets out of the repository, the project remains completely legal.
